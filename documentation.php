                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">A family is the heart of any person's social group. And as much as we would like to,
                            keeping in touch and organizing events with all of our family members can be difficult.
                            People move. Contact points change. Calendars rarley sync. How to we make sure that heart keeps beating?<p>

                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"><strong>A little more detail...</strong><p>
                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">One of the beautiful things about familink is you never have to worry about keeping up with everyone's current contact info! It is
                                always here! If Uncle Bob gets a new cell phone number, he can edit his details...and Mom doesn't need to change it in her phone. If Cousin
                                Julie graduates and loses her school email, she can change that to her new work address...so the next time Grandma sends an email inviting
                                people to dinner next Friday, Julie will definitely be showing up! Even though a detail may change for one member, everyone
                                else in the family instantly has access to that change all from a central location.</p>
                            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Extending from this, through familink, users are able to leverage their family members' current emails with the Family Unit feature!
                                When sending emails from familink, Julie no longer needs to remember to type every cousin's email address, some of which may be outdated, 
                                when sending the invite to the cousins' baseball game next month. She can simply select "Cousins" and send! With Family Units, users
                                can send emails to the Whole Family, individual Family Units, or individual members...knowing every email will get sent to the right people
                                at valid addresses, and, more importantly, received by them!</p>
                            <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Familink. Keeping families linked!</p>
                            <br>
                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;"><strong>So get me this thing!</strong><p>
                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">To sign up your family for an account, simply click "Create a Family" and follow the steps! It's free! 
                            After doing so, you will create a private administrator account that will be used to create, monitor, and organize your family-share
                            account and credentials. This keeps things easy for the whole family to better use this app.<p>
                        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">If your family already has an account, contact your administrator for the common username and password
                            your whole family shares.<p>
                        <br>
